pip install win10toast requests
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IonImpulse/TTP-Alerts.git && cd TTP-Alerts && python main.py
```

This will start it up. Find the center you want to monitor and enter its ID number. 
Now you can sit back and do other work on your computer while it runs in the background.
It will send a notification to your computer whenever a new appointment is available at the center you're monitoring.


You'll need to quickly go to ```https://ttp.cbp.dhs.gov`` and login to your account to book the appointment.
These appointments are usually booked within a minute or two of the notification, so you'll need to be quick.
